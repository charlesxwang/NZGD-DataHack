# NZGD-DataHack
This script is used to bulk-download data from NZGD.

Currently NZGD does not open to public so you may need a username and a password.

Use:

Just run hackNZGDReally.py, if login successed, you can manually zoom the map to sellect your ROI and customize your data, then the script will record the urls in a file.

Then you run downloader.py, all data will be downloaded by calling chrome parallelly.
